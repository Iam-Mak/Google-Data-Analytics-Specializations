- [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Iam-Mak/Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Case%20Study%202%20:%20How%20Can%20a%20Wellness%20Technology%20Company%20Play%20It%20Smart%20%3F/Case%20Study%202%20%20How%20Can%20a%20Wellness%20Technology%20Company%20Play%20It%20Smart%20%20.ipynb)
## 1. Ask
Analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. 
- 1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
- 2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
- 3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## 2. Prepare
[FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain): This Kaggle data set
contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users.
#### Data Consent 
Thirty Three eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of
personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. <br>
[Metadata](https://www.fitabase.com/media/1930/fitabasedatadictionary102320.pdf) contains information about the data types and data description.
- Data is organized in 18 CSV files. It has both long and wide formats.
- This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between `03/12/2016 - 05/12/2016`.

#### 2.1 Limitations of Data Set:
- Data collected from year 2016, hence data may not be timely or relevant.
- Sample size of 33 female FitBit users is not representative of the entire female population.
- As data is collected in a survey, hence unable to ascertain the integrity or accuracy of data.

#### 2.2 Is Data ROCCC?
A good data source is **ROCCC** which stands for **Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current,** and **Cited**.

- **Reliable -** *LOW* - Not reliable as it only has 33 respondents
- **Original -** *LOW* - Third party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk)
- **Comprehensive** - *MED* - Parameters match most of Bellabeat's products' parameters
- **Current** - *LOW* - Data is more than 5 years old and is not relevant
- **Cited** - *LOW* - Data collected from third party, hence unknown

### 3.2 Data Cleaning 
#### daily_activity

- daily_activity dataframe doesn't contain any null values (missing values)
- Remove rows  that the `total_steps` is <= 100 (87 rows removed) or  it would distort the daily averages.
- `total_distance` and `track_distance`are almost identical (838 rows are equal)
- Add columns that contains `day of the week` , `day of the week number` and `total_hours` of each user.

#### weight_log
- In `weight_log` we have total 8 different columns and 67 entries and 8 unique users.
- delete the columns LogId and Fat as they do not hve any relevant information.

#### hourly_calories
- In `hourly_calories` we have total 3 different columns and 22099 entries and 33 unique users.
- hourly_calories dataframe doesn't contain any null values (missing values)

- The Sedentary minutes is around 983.5 which is fairly high compare to others.
- Users are most active between 12pm and 2pm (lunchtime) and from 5pm till 7pm (after work) on weekdays.
